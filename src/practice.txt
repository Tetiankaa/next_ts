    - 'default': The default behavior of the browser, which might include using a cached response.
    - 'no-store': Forces a new request and prevents the browser from caching the response.
    - 'reload': Forces a new request, but the browser may still check for updates in the cache before making the network request.
    - 'no-cache': Requests a new response from the server but allows the server to determine whether the cached version can be used after validation.
    - 'force-cache': Forces the browser to use a cached version without checking for updates.
