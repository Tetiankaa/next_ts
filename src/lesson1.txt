Next.js is a framework that simplifies the process of building React applications.
Supports server-side rendering(SSR): when a user requests a page, the server generates the HTML content on the server side and sends it to the client.
Static site generation(SSG): allows pre-render pages at build time

API routes: allows to create serverless API endpoints within next project, making it easy to handle backend logic

Routing: is like giving directions to a website.When you type a URL into browser, routing tells the website which page to show.

Folders in app folder are used to define routes. -> Files are used to create UI.
To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other.

redirects() func - allows to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path

(main-layout) - urls will not directly include "main-layout" in url path

npm run dev - will start the development server

-----------------------------------------------

Link: is a component that allows to navigate between pages in application.
It prevents the default browser full-page refresh and fetches the new page content on the client side,resulting in a faster and smoother user experience.

useRouter: is a hook that allows to access the router object and its properties, also allows to navigate to different pages.

Dynamic routes: refer to a feature that allows to create web pages with variable or dynamic parts in the URL.

Catch_All Routes[...folderName]: allows to capture multiple URL segments and treat them as a dynamic array of values.
This is useful when you want to create dynamic routes that can handle varying numbers of URL segments.

Layout: is like a blueprint that helps make all the pages of the website look the same. It's a way to put common things, header, footer that appears on every page in one place.
